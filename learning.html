<h2>Earthquake</h2>
<p>An earthquake is a sudden, rapid shaking of the ground caused by the shifting of rocks deep underneath the earth’s
    surface. Earthquakes can cause fires, tsunamis, landslides or avalanches. While they can happen anywhere without
    warning, areas at higher risk for earthquakes</p>

<h2>Hurricane</h2>
<p>A hurricane is a type of storm called a tropical cyclone, which forms over tropical or subtropical waters.And a
    tropical cyclone with winds of 74 miles (119 kilometers) per hour or greater that is usually accompanied by rain,
    thunder, and lightning, and that sometimes moves into temperate latitudes.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Avoid driving or going outdoors during a storm. Flooding and damaging winds can make traveling dangerous.</li>
    <li>Stay indoors and away from windows.</li>
    <li>Look before you step. After a hurricane or flood, the ground and floors can be covered with debris, including
        broken bottles and nails.</li>
    <li>Stay away from downed utility wires. Always assume a downed power line is live.</li>
    <li>If your home or property is damaged, take photos or videos to document damage, and contact your insurance
        company.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Wildfires</h2>
<p>Wildfires (also known as bushfires, brush fires or forest fires) are large, uncontrolled and potentially destructive
    fires that can affect both rural and urban areas. They can spread quickly, change direction and even 'jump' across
    large distances when embers and sparks are carried by the wind.</p>

<h2>Floods</h2>
<p>Flooding is an overflow of water that can range from a few inches deep to fully submerging entire buildings.It can
    occur when rivers and lakes cannot contain excessive rain or snow melt, or when rain cannot be absorbed fully into
    the ground. Flooding can also occur when waterways overflow due to debris or ice, when winds from tropical storms or
    hurricanes cause storm surge in coastal areas, or when water containment systems (such as levees, dams, pipes)
    break.</p>
<h4>What To Do When Facing a Flood</h4>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>Avoid building in flood prone areas unless you elevate and reinforce your home.</li>
    <li>Consider unplugging sensitive electronic equipment before flood</li>
    <li>Avoid camping or parking along streams, rivers, creeks, or other areas prone to flooding during heavy rainfall. These areas can flood rapidly and with little warning.</li>
    <li>If you must evacuate your home, take only essential items and bring your pets if safe to do so.</li>
    <li>Do not drive around road barriers. Roads and bridges may be washed out or structurally unsound.</li>
</ul>
